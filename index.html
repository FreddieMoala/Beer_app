        <h2>IBU</h2>
        <p>Stands for International Bitterness Units, a scale that measures the bitterness of beer. IBU is based on the amount of hops and their alpha acids that are added to the beer. The higher the IBU, the more bitter the beer
        </p>
        <h2>SRM</h2>
        <p>The Standard Reference Method, abbreviated as SRM is the color system used by brewers to specify finished beer and malt color.
        </p>
        <h2>Attenuation Level</h2>
        <p>Attenuation of beer is a measure of how fully fermentable the beers sugars are. It is usually expressed as a percentage, which can be interpreted as the percentage of extract in the beer that is converted to alcohol and carbon dioxide by the yeasts.
